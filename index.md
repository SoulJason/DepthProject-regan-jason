# Softdes Partner Finder Game


##          By Jason Lin and Regan Mah

### SoftDes Partner Finder is a game that focuses on you--the player character--as you traverse the Software Design landscape to find the perfect partner. As anyone individual with a mind of their own, you have preferences on who you'd prefer to work in a project with and this is crucial to your academic success. This decision could mean the difference between life or death, so take your due diligence and scout out the local talent!

## How The Game Was Made

### When we decided to create a game using python, we decided on using the framework pygame to set our foundation.
