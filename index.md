## What is Softdes Partner Finder

### SoftDes Partner Finder is a game that focuses on you--the player character--as you traverse the Software Design landscape to find the perfect partner. Like most other individuals with a mind of their own, you have preferences on who you'd prefer to work in a project with and this is crucial to your academic success. This decision could mean the difference between life or death, so take your due diligence and scout out the local talent!

## How The Game Was Made

### When we decided to create a game using python, we decided on using the framework pygame to set our foundation. From there we used pygame's numerous tools (as well as lots of pictures of doges from the internet) to create the classroom environment and the classmates.

## Download the game

### To download the game, head to this link: https://github.com/sd2020spring/DepthProject-regan-jason
### You'll want to make sure to read the README (as it tells you which files that you need as well as the controls) and then just simply run the partner_finder_run.py in python. The game window should pop up, and you should be able to talk to your fellow classmates!

## The Gameplay Loop

### Instead of human beings, the software design class will be filled with dogs this time around.

### Every student (21 in total including you) will have randomly generated traits everytime you play the game. To find out what your traits are, you will have to speak to the professor on the top left part of the game window. You will then have to talk to all your classmates to find out their traits. You will have an option to select your partner on the spot at the end of your dialogue with any student to lock in your choice. Your objective is to choose someone who has all 3 traits that match with yours.

### Depending on your decision, there will be 3 different endings you can get depending on your compatability with your partner. Good luck and have fun!

## About the creators

### Regan is an Olin student while Jason is a Babson student. They were randomly paired for Mini-project 4, but had such a good final project idea that even in the face of COVID, they were prepared to see it through. This wonderful game is a simulation (not really) of the Olin Softdes class environment, and the joys of knowing that people have different work habits, and how they may or may not mesh well. Regan and Jason (despite being from Olin and Babson) managed to create a game that reminds us all that its okay to work with others, and in fact, you may get more out of it than you would think.
